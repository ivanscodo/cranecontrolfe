# Cranecontrol project for the hiring process of Ivan Sotelo Codo

After have cloned this repo run the following commands on the root folder in order to be able to run the application:  
1 - npm install (you need to have npm installed in your machine)  
2 - npm serve --open  

<br />

Observations  
1 - Due to time constraints I decided to skip the item number 4 of the specification because it would take much more time than the 8 hours allocated to this task.  
2 - We skipped the visualization of the cranes, tests, logs, and documentation but the application is runnable.
